## Reporting a vulnerability

If you want to report a vulnerability you can do so by creating an issue.

We will try to get to you as soon as possible. We take security vulnerabilities very serious. If your security can be verified and is accepted you can expect it to see it in the next minor/major release. If it has been denied it means that there is no interest in fixing the issue right away and we will try to get it in a release when there are less issues.
